This folder contains the iOS client for Orchid. To build it, you need to not only have the usual developer dependencies for Orchid installed, but you will also need to have a developer signing certificate and (likely) some provisioning profiles to develop the application (which you will have to set up manually in the Apple Developer portal); more information on this is in the root project's local.mk.in. The actual build is then done by simply running "make" (we do not support using Xcode).
