# Vision
Our vision is to enable secure access to the internet for everyone, everywhere.

# Overview
Welcome to Orchid!

The Orchid network enables a decentralized virtual private network (VPN),
allowing users to buy bandwidth from a decentralized pool of service providers.

To do this, Orchid uses an ERC-20 utility token called OXT, a new VPN protocol
for token-incentivized bandwidth proxying, and smart-contracts with algorithmic
advertising and payment functions. Orchid's users connect to bandwidth sellers
using a provider directory, and they pay using probabilistic nanopayments so
Ethereum transaction fees on packets are acceptably low.

# Pick a Key Topic
* [Orchid Accounts](https://docs.orchid.com/en/stable/accounts/): Orchid accounts are the decentralized entities that store digital currency on a blockchain to pay for services through nanopayments. The nanopayment smart contract governs Orchid accounts. The Orchid client requires an account in order to pay for VPN service. 
* [The Orchid Client](https://docs.orchid.com/en/stable/using-orchid/): An open-source, Virtual Private Network (VPN) client that supports decentralized Orchid accounts, as well as WireGuard and OpenVPN connections. The client can string together multiple VPN tunnels in an [onion route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing) and can provide local traffic analysis.
* [The Orchid DApp](https://docs.orchid.com/en/stable/orchid-dapp/): The Orchid dApp allows you to create and manage Orchid Accounts. The operations supported by the account manager are simply an interface to the decentralized smart contract that holds the funds and governs how they are added and removed.
* [Security & Technical FAQs](https://docs.orchid.com/en/stable/faq/): Security, how our system works and other non-product frequently asked questions.
