This might look a bit like a Flutter project scaffold... but it is not! Instead, this is just/only the dart code and manifest for the Orchid-branded Orchid GUI (which is written in, but not normally built, using Flutter). To build the Orchid application--and its various native components (including any embedded client daemon functionality)--go under one of the app-* folders (for whichever platform you are targetting) and run "make".
